## This is an extension packaging to add more mod configuration
Check rickie26k.valheim.monsterlabzconfig.cfg for options.

While config reloading is built in I would strongly advise to not change
configuration for an existing world unless you know some of the inner workings
with mod loading.

This depends on the fix version, https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/MonsterLabZFix/MonsterLabZ/
and uses the dll as an import. To install this mod fully:
Create a folder named Managed_Data in the MonsterLabZConfig plugin directory.
Copy the MonsterLabZ.dll to this directory and rename it MonsterLabZ.libassembly

## This version has a little changes

## Original description

Release Notes: https://discord.gg/rdAxvuVXPa

A handful of the creatures spawn by default, for the rest you can configure the spawns with spawnthat or use a configuration manager ingame. (Warning: Installing a new version will override your previous config) You can check out the prefablist in Discord to see what spawns by default.

Please do not reupload this dll. Make this a requirement.
